This is the So Make It constitution. The text of the constitution was
agreed by the trustees on 6th February 2013. Since then only formatting
changes have happened, and the document has been (automatically)
converted to markdown and HTML.

The constitution is the Association Model Constitution for a CIO
[as provided by the Charity Commission][CIO PDF], linked from
[this page][CC CIO FAQ].

### Files in this repo:

 * constitution.txt - the textually formatted constitution, agreed by
   the committee
 * constitution.md - a markdown version of constitution.txt, purely for
   convenience - it is not well formatted (especially at the end).
 * html/ - the HTML version and it's dependencies. This is important.
 * convert.sh - a script to convert the .txt file to .md and .html
